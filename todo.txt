---------------

- rewrite the frame buffer code to optimise the true colour version

- clean out the remaining original commented out cotvnc code

x improve makefile

- rework EventFilter to be more UIKit specific

x modified keys don't work on windows with free RealVNC

- get rid of emulation buttons and multitap emulation stuff

- text cursor sometimes appears on top of screen view after keyboard is made visible

- rotation:
	- always revert to portrait mode in the list view
	- rotate the scroller so the scroll bars always appear on the right and bottom sides

- zooming:
	- make use of gestures and the built-in functionality in UIKit

- clean up method names

- get rid of type prefixes on variable names (i.e., b and w)

- use the navigation bar correctly (i.e., one navbar instance)

- create a model class to manage server list
